- 🌱 I’m actively learning about code automation, software testing, and CI/CD pipelines to enhance the efficiency and reliability of development workflows.
  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to machine learning and HPC, especially those that intersect with mathematical modelling and numerical simulations.
  
- 💬 Ask me about Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Finite Element Method (FEM), Algebraic Multigrid(AMG) Solver and their applications in solving complex physical problems through computational methods.
  
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to email me at tirthoss109@gmail.com for collaboration, questions, or just to say hi!
  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a fan of Manim, the mathematical animation engine by 3Blue1Brown. Check it out here: [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim). It's an incredible tool for creating engaging mathematical visuals!

  ### 🛠️ My Favorite Tools and Languages

My projects are primarily built using the following languages and tools:

- **Python**: My go-to language for data analysis, machine learning projects, and scripting.
- **Julia**: I love using Julia for high-performance scientific computing tasks, thanks to its speed and ease of use.
- **C++**: I engage with C++ for its robustness, using it to deepen my understanding of efficient and structured coding practices for optimal performance.

Each of these languages offers unique advantages for different types of projects, and I'm always excited to leverage their strengths to solve complex problems.
