Here are some details about me:

- 💻 **Running Projects**: I am currently working with FBPINNs for Continuum Mechanics problems, Stacking FBPINNs for time-dependent problems, and FBPINN.jl as a Julia package. 
- 🔭 **Master's Thesis**: Modle learning using machine learning and domain decomposition ([repo](https://github.com/tirtho109/MasterThesis)). Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) tools: [FBPINNs](https://github.com/benmoseley/FBPINNs), [SciANN](https://github.com/sciann/sciann), and [PySINDy](https://github.com/dynamicslab/pysindy).
  
- 🌱 **Learning**: Code automation, software testing, CI/CD pipelines.
  
- 👯 **Collaboration**: Open to software development, machine learning, and HPC projects, especially in mathematical modeling and numerical simulations.
  
- 💬 **Expertise**: PINNs, Finite Element Method (FEM), Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) Solver.
  
- 📫 **Contact**: [Email](tirthoss109@gmail.com) me for collaborations or queries. or just to say hi!
  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
  
- ⚡ **Fun Fact**: Fan of [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) by 3Blue1Brown. It's an incredible tool for creating engaging mathematical visuals!

### 🛠️ Preferred Tools and Languages

- **Python**: For data analysis, machine learning, and scripting.
- **Julia**: For high-performance scientific computing.
- **C++**: For its robustness and understanding of efficient, structured coding.

**I leverage each language's strengths to tackle complex problems across various projects.**
